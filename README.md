# Hi, I'm William ðŸ‘‹

I'm a college student majoring in data science, and I apply things I learn in areas that interest me (mainly sports)
I like to combine statistics, storytelling, and visualizations to breakdown complex things and make them easy to understand. 

- I run a YouTube channel analyzing MLB trends (@Wilytics) 
- My work here focuses on applying machine learning techniques to model patterns in sports
- Skilled in Python, SQL, R, Stata, Machine Learning
